<h2>School Info</h2>
<p>The Achievers School is a vanguard school in 21st-century education, offering the CBSE curriculum coupled with world-class experiential learning methodologies. Children are at the centre of our universe, and we endeavour to provide a personalized learning experience to every child.

    We at Achievers channelize their energy and motivate them to discover and nurture their multiple intelligences to the best of their potential. We encourage children to learn concepts, understand their real-life implementations, and grow up making their discoveries & decisions.
    
    We create a community of teachers, parents, friends, and society around students for instilling values, developing life skills, and ensuring complete wellness (body, mind & soul) of the child, which is essential for the future. In this community, we encourage students to compete with themselves rather than with others and build their future on the strong foundation of their thoughts, creativity, talent, and communication.</p>
